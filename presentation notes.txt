	high level challenges - making api calls from travel websites was hard due to their commercially driven options

discuss coding challenge 1 - candido - 30 seconds to a min would be good
	use of class - collecting multiple bits of information in the code

discuss coding challenge 2 - troy - maybe discuss 2, don't have to do all 3. 30 seconds to a minute is okay
